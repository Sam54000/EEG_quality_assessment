    "# Introduction, Description\n",
    "This notebook is dedicated to the development of a pipeline that perform a quality assessment of an eeg signal.\n",
    "The different metrics will be calculated:\n",
    "- Average Root Mean Square (RMS) of a sliding window\n",
    "- Maximum Gradient of a sliding window\n",
    "- Zero Crossing Rate of a sliding window\n",
    "- Complexity of the signal (Hjorth's parameters) of a sliding window\n",
    "- Kurtosis of a sliding window\n",
    "- Skewness of a sliding window\n",
    "- Variance of a sliding window\n",
    "- Range of a sliding window\n",
    "- Interquartile range of a sliding window\n",
    "- Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)\n",
    "    - Time domain: \n",
    "        - ECG based epochs (signal = average across epochs, noise = std across epochs) need to be lowered\n",
    "        - TR based epochs (signal = average across epochs, noise = std across epochs) need to be lowered\n",
    "        - EEG based epochs (signal = average across epochs, noise = std across epochs) need to be increased\n",
    "    - Frequency domain:\n",
    "        - Gradient artifacts (signal = peak frequency of the cross-correlation of the non-cleaned signal, noise = average of the n surrounding bins around the peak)\n",
    "        - Base frequency of the task (signal = amplitude at the base freqeuency, noise = average of the n surrounding bins around the peak)"
